Listed buildings mobile app
An Android app (BuildingApp) that shows users the location of their nearest listed historic buildings in the UK and gives access to the
corresponding listing information. To learn more about the app see the page here.

Mapping city-level food access
In partnership with the Liverpool good food initative I developed an interactive map that shows levels of access to food in the city.
The map allows food supply within the city to be visualised in terms of areas that are further away from food support initatives and which
due to higher levels of deprivation are potentially at greater risk of food insecurity. The map is accessible
here.
