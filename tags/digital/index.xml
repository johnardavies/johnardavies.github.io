      <title>Cloud 4: Introduction to using Serverless</title>

      <description>La Cabane Éclatée aux 4 Salles, Daniel Buren at the Gori collection
What is Serverless? In previous posts we spun up virtual machines to work in the cloud, but the cloud can also perform specific functions for us without having to run any servers, so called serverless computing. The servers providing the services still exist, but they are managed by the cloud provider while we deal with the services directly.</description>

      <title>Cloud 3: Docker and Jupyter notebooks in the Cloud</title>

      <description>Kings Cross underpass rotated, London
In the last post we covered some basic operations with cloud machines, in this post we discuss using containers to replicate environments in the cloud (Docker) and how to containerise a Jupyter notebook.
Docker has become a standard way to package applications enabling something that runs on one machine to run on another. It is a container which holds a virtualisation of an operating system within which applications can be packaged to allow them to move between machines.</description>

      <description>Clouds over the Lea valley, London
In the last post we covered setting up a virtual machine in the cloud, logging into it via ssh and securing it. However, this gets us a virtual machine running in the cloud costing us money, it isn&amp;rsquo;t doing anything useful. To work with the virtual machine there are some other basic things that it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to be able to do.
1. Getting things on and off the cloud machine</description>

      <title>The Simulation Machine: The digital issue we don’t talk about and its implications for the creative economy</title>

      <description>The digital issue we don’t discuss and its implications for the creative economy Computers’ ability to effectively simulate a huge variety of functions has allowed them to replace hi-fis, cameras, maps, DVD players, calculators, typewriters, cash registers, musical instruments, watches, TVs, newspapers, books, shopfronts, money and more. Although the changes caused by the general-purpose power of computation are widely observed, it is arguably less discussed than the role of data and/or the costless copying of information.</description>

      <description>An algorithmic Deep Dream at the school of Athens, John Davies
From algorithmic creations to transforming galleries Art is free. It doesn’t need to represent anything. It doesn’t need to be beautiful. It doesn’t need to be an object. It doesn’t need to be new. Despite these liberations, it is notable how comparatively little artists&#39; tools have changed. Particularly when compared to the digital revolution’s effect on many other creative domains, with entire supply chains collapsing to a laptop, some servers and an internet connection.</description>

      <title>Collective action and anonymity - two tools to stimulate innovation in the data economy</title>

      <description>Data is different from other assets like gold and oil in that almost all of us, as individuals, generate it. Giving us more control over our own data will stimulate innovation, but realising the full potential will also involve collective action and anonymisation.
Power to the people: Giving us control over our own data We should be empowered to control our own data. This is due to our part in its creation, our right to privacy for our personal information, the growing likelihood that this data will be processed in ways that affect us, but also the economic and social good that can be realised from it.</description>

      <title>Selling yourself: four issues and four implications about markets for personal data</title>

      <description>Establishing new markets where things can be priced and traded creates incentives for people and companies to work out how much something is worth to them and to trade and innovate accordingly. It is hoped that allowing us a greater ability to control access to our personal data, in exchange for services and money, could encourage similar benefits.[1]
Part of this may involve the growth of Personal Information Management Services (PIMS).</description>

      <description>‘Something is free, if someone else pays’ - Anon.
We get many free goods and services online via an opaque barter where, in exchange, companies access our data and try and sell us things. We say we care about our data[1], though if we could retain it, but pay for these products, would we? This option is not always available, but even if it was, it is not clear that we would take it.</description>

      <description>“But we don&amp;rsquo;t want to teach &amp;lsquo;em,&amp;quot; replied the Badger. &amp;ldquo;We want to learn &amp;lsquo;em” Wind in the Willows, Kenneth Grahame.*
We are told that the future of the UK economy lies in a better educated, and hence more productive, workforce. Some of this extra productivity is expected to come from the intellectual benefits of higher education - an area where there is an ever greater focus on student choice. What is less often noted is that the market for university degrees has many characteristics which make it difficult for student choice to drive higher levels of teaching quality.</description>

      <description>Geotagged photos in central London, John Davies. Image based on the locations of over a million geo-tagged photos on Flickr by 38,255 photographers or, at least, photo accounts.
Social media data, such as that produced by Twitter and Facebook use, is opening up new ways to understand society, but how do people obtain this data, and what are the challenges in using it to learn about our lives?

      <description>The Printers won’t kill the Pin Factory To hear some of the talk around 3D printers one could be forgiven for thinking they’ll transform us all into a collection of skilled artisans creating in our bedrooms. Regardless of what one makes of other spectres that have been raised (neighbours running off 3D guns and the undermining of copyright) this seems an undeniably attractive image. Though it probably won&amp;rsquo;t be quite like that in reality, for a rather old-fashioned reason.</description>

      <description>Es Devlin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;BLUEWHITESKY&amp;rdquo; at the 2021 LUX exhibition
More and more of the digital services we use involve the cloud, where the computing is not done on our laptop or mobile, but accessed over the internet. However, coming across its technical details for the first time, the cloud can be slightly opaque to someone whose background is not computing - I certainly found it that way. From a data science perspective working with it involves things that are not related to statistics, machine learning or even programming narrowly defined.</description>
