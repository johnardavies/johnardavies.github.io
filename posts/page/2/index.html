    <p>Street Art in Shoreditch, photograph John Davies
It begins: an area near the city centre is less developed, artists and independent businesses move in, culture and creativity thrive increasing the area’s visibility and desirability. At which point a less fashionable (but richer) crowd arrives, rents and prices rise and the artists/independents, and original inhabitants, get forced out. Many of us intuitively feel there’s something troubling about this, and it has been a focus of much debate in London in particular, but our reasons for caring about it are often not entirely clear - which isn’t to say we shouldn’t care....</p>

    <h2>Selling yourself: four issues and four implications about markets for personal data
    </h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Establishing new markets where things can be priced and traded creates incentives for people and companies to work out how much something is worth to them and to trade and innovate accordingly. It is hoped that allowing us a greater ability to control access to our personal data, in exchange for services and money, could encourage similar benefits.[1]
Part of this may involve the growth of Personal Information Management Services (PIMS)....</p>

    <h2>HAL&#39;s revenge: The computer as 21st century reviewer

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Art is, of course, about emotions, society, things it’s impolite to talk to strangers about (sex, politics and religion), etc. Ostensible meanings aside, very sophisticated interpretations are possible and there is the massive literature of criticism devoted to this. Art’s shapeshifting, eternally changing, nature (installation art, post-modernism, post-internet, who knows what next) is a challenging moving target - even for humans. Nevertheless, there are reasons to think that computers will be increasingly influential in assessing it....</p>

    <p>‘Something is free, if someone else pays’ - Anon.
We get many free goods and services online via an opaque barter where, in exchange, companies access our data and try and sell us things. We say we care about our data[1], though if we could retain it, but pay for these products, would we? This option is not always available, but even if it was, it is not clear that we would take it....</p>

    <p>Locations of geo-tagged photographs taken in central and inner London, John Davies
Into the city In the past, people walked the streets and left no trace. This is no longer true. We are creating large amounts of data about the places around us: how we move through them, and how they move us. One source of this data has been the growth in smart phone and social media use.[1] The geotagged social media data generated by phones and cameras is producing information on a large number of people’s interactions with their surroundings....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Don’t forget the unelected. Not those shortly to be unsuccessful in the election, but the great unsolved problem of British politics: House of Lords reform. A problem notable for the lack of excitement surrounding the proposed solutions. We should change the terms of debate and consider using technology to involve the public in Parliament’s second chamber in a radical new way.
Members of the House of Lords currently occupy their seats by virtue of birth or political appointment (plus a few more through religious status)....</p>

    <p>“But we don’t want to teach ‘em,&#34; replied the Badger. “We want to learn ‘em” Wind in the Willows, Kenneth Grahame.*
We are told that the future of the UK economy lies in a better educated, and hence more productive, workforce. Some of this extra productivity is expected to come from the intellectual benefits of higher education - an area where there is an ever greater focus on student choice. What is less often noted is that the market for university degrees has many characteristics which make it difficult for student choice to drive higher levels of teaching quality....</p>

    <p>The Printers won’t kill the Pin Factory To hear some of the talk around 3D printers one could be forgiven for thinking they’ll transform us all into a collection of skilled artisans creating in our bedrooms. Regardless of what one makes of other spectres that have been raised (neighbours running off 3D guns and the undermining of copyright) this seems an undeniably attractive image. Though it probably won’t be quite like that in reality, for a rather old-fashioned reason....</p>
