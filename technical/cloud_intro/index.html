More and more services will use the cloud in future. However, coming across its technical details for the first time, the cloud can seem slightly mysterious to someone whose original background is not computing - I certainly found it that way. From a data science perspective working with it involves things that are not related to statistics, machine learning or even programming narrowly defined.\nVirtual machines are one of the fundamental building blocks of cloud services and an obvious starting point to the topic. In this post I cover:\n1. Setting up a virtual machine in the cloud\n2. Increasing the security of the machine\n3. Stopping the machine and turning it off\nA virtual machine in the cloud can allow access to much greater computing power than we can access on a laptop, allowing data processing and model training to be sped up. Alternatively we can also use a less powerful virtual machine to remotely host API calls, webscraping or a site without having to worry about keeping our laptop open to run them.\nIt’s probably true that tools like google colab or serverless are reducing the need for data scientists to directly use virtual machines. However as the cloud will only get more important, knowing more about its core components is useful in general. It also makes it easier to work with different cloud providers as virtual machines are a standard offer.\nPrerequisites The prerequisites are some knowledge of the basics of the command line and networking. If these are less familiar a good way to learn them, or at least I found it helpful, is to buy a raspberry pi and learn how to login remotely to it over your local network (so called “headless login”) as this is similar to many of the steps here - the raspberry pi is effectively acting as a local remote machine analagous to the virtual machine in the cloud. A benefit of this approach is that the cost of doing this is fixed and there are fewer security issues as the pi won’t be on the public internet.\nThe instructions should work from a Mac or PC (using windows subsystem for linux) as the local machine. The cloud machine will be linux as this is the most common operating system in the cloud - even on the Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform.\nThe warning no cloud tutorial is without The cloud can be many things, but one thing it is not is free. Although many cloud platforms have free credits for new users, it is important to look at the cost of services before using them, to regularly monitor usage and costs and to turn things off - otherwise things can get expensive.\n1. Setting up a Virtual Machine in the cloud In this example we use a virtual machine (VM) from the cloud provider Digital Ocean. Digital Ocean call their virtual machines Droplets, but in practice there is a lot of similarity between cloud providers' virtual machines. In large part this is because they are mostly linux based, although size and capacity (and hence cost) can vary a lot. Using a virtual machine from another provider such as Amazon Web Service’s (AWS) EC2 instances is not dissimilar, although in the case of AWS there are some different actions in the set-up and the billing is not capped.\nAfter having created an account, navigate to the Create button in Digital Ocean and select Droplets from the dropdown. We select an Ubuntu instance version of linux on the smallest plan cost which is $5 a month. We choose a local datacenter and a form of authentification. From the authentification options we use Secure Shell (SSH) key based authentification, rather than password based login as this is more secure as it prevents someone guessing the password. If you don’t have an existing key to set up go to the New SSH Key button and follow the steps. To generate a key run $ ssh-keygen from the command line which will then prompt you to save and name the keys giving it a password. This will generate two keys: The private one (id_rsa) and the public one (id_rsa.pub) - these are the default names for a new key which will be saved to the ssh folder. Use $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to see the public key and copy and paste this into the indicated field.\nSelect the number of droplets you want to launch. In this case 1 and give the droplet a hostname such as test-virtual-machine. Finally when all the fields are finished hit the Create Droplet button at the bottom and the droplet will launch.\nThe droplet will then launch and its details will be visible (including what its ip address is) under the Droplets tab under Manage. If you replace the ip_address below with the Droplet’s IP address and you should be able to log in from your local machine’s command line using: $ ssh root@ip_address\nif you have multiple ssh keys add the -i flag to add the path to the specific private key you are using: $ ssh -i /path/to/private_key username@ip_address The first time you do this you will asked:\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? Type yes and hit enter and you should see something like the screen below. You now have a machine that, until you turn it off, can run programmes that you want remotely or act as web server 24/7. However, as stands it could be more secure so we take some steps to address this.\n2. Increasing the security of the machine Unfortunately this stage is necessary as with the virtual machine on the public internet it will quickly be subject to repeated login attempts from bots around the world who are trying to break in.\nIf you want to see these $ lastb | more from the command line of the virtual machine will show you a list of failed login attempts on your virtual machine (The more command makes the list scrollable which quickly becomes necessary given the number of login attempts).\nA small sample of unwanted visitors To help make the virtual machine more secure we therefore:\n Activate a Firewall for the virtual machine which restricts how it can be accessed Create an account which has restricted privileges and only allows access to the machine via that account  In AWS a lot of this is handled through what are known as Identity and Access Managment (IAM) roles. Here we use a standard linux firewall and restrictions on who has access privileges so this is less dependent on the specifics of Digital Ocean. The commands here should be executed on the virtual machine.\n2.1 Activate a Firewall\nTo reduce the scope for this we lock down all but one of the ports using a firewall leaving the only means of access the login ssh.\n**1.**Installing Uncomplicated Fire Wall (UFW). It should already be installed, but if not, this will install the latest version. The cursor now appears as # as we are logged in as root (The account with the highest level of privilege).\n# apt install ufw2. Enable ufw to run. The default is to deny all incoming connections and allow all outgoing connections.\n# ufw enable3. Check to see if ufw is running.\n# ufw status4. Allow ssh connections. This will allow us to only connect with ssh on port 22, which is the standard port for SSH.\n# ufw allow ssh5. Restrict the rate at which SSH connections can be formed - this blocks connections from IPs that have attempted 6 or more connections in past 30 seconds.\n# ufw limit ssh2.2 Create a new user account and prevent access with unrestricted privileges\\\nWe create a user account which we will use to log into the virtual machine going ahead and then delete the direct root access. The reason for doing this is that the default way of logging in with root access gives the user unlimited privileges on the virtual machine, so if someone broke in with the root access default they can do what they want - including locking us out of the system. Allowing access to the root privileges from a new account only with a password restricts this from happening as someone who got access to the machine would also need to force the password to get this level of control.\n1. To create a new user account, here called new_user. It will ask you for a password for root access and to input some information on the user.\n# adduser new_user2. Give the user ‘new_user’ the admin privileges.\n# usermod -aG sudo new_user3. Check you can get the admin privileges. It will prompt you for the new_user password.\n# su - new_user after this it will switch to new_user@test-virtual-machine.4. Assuming we want to use the same key for the new user copy the key details over to the new user. # rsync --archive --chown=new_user:new_user ~/.ssh /home/new_user\\ Check ~/.ssh is not written as ~/.ssh/ as if this happens it will copy the whole directory and not just the key5. Now log out and check you can ssh into the virtual machine as the new user. It will ask for the key password.\n$ ssh -i /path/to/private_key new_user@ip_address6. Assuming you can do all this, edit the sshd_config to forbid root logins.\n$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_configand change the PermitRootLogin line so it reads PermitRootLogin no.\n7. Restart the service so that the changes take effect.\n$ sudo service sshd restartFrom now on log in as the new user$ ssh -i /path/to/private_key new_user@ip_addressThere are further security restrictions one can implement such as Fail2Ban which will block ip addresses if they make incorrect login attempts more than a set number of times. If the virtual machine is on for an extended length of time it is also important to make sure it is kept up to date, using $ sudo apt-get update \u0026\u0026 apt-get upgrade. The update command updates the list of available packages and upgrade installs the latest version of the packages that the machine has.`\n2.3 Turning things off\nTo log out of the virtual machine $ exit will log you out.\nTo stop the virtual machine running and delete its contents permenantly\n$ shutdown -h now\nYou can turn droplets off which will maintain their state if you relaunch them (although you will still be billed for them while stopped) or destroy them which will remove them completely. The terminology is similar with AWS where EC2 virtual machine instances are ‘stopped’ and ‘destroyed’\nSources:\nDigital Ocean, Guidance on ssh connections https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/openssh/\nDigital Ocean, Guidance on ufw https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-limiting-ssh-connections-with-ufw-on-ubuntu-debian/\nGite, V.

                    a laptop, allowing data processing and model training to be sped up. Alternatively we can also use a
                    less powerful virtual machine
                    to remotely host API calls, webscraping or a site without having to worry about keeping our laptop
                    open to run them.</p>
                <p>It&rsquo;s probably true that tools like google colab or serverless are reducing the need for data
                    scientists to directly use virtual machines. However as the cloud will only get more important,
                    knowing more about its core components is useful in general. It also makes it easier to work with
                    different cloud providers as virtual machines are a standard offer.</p>
                <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>
                    The prerequisites are some knowledge of the basics of the command line and networking. If these are
                    less familiar a good way to learn them, or at least I found it helpful, is to buy a raspberry pi and
                    learn how to login remotely to it over your local network (so called &ldquo;headless login&rdquo;)
                    as this is similar to many of the steps here - the raspberry pi is effectively acting as a local
                    remote machine analagous to the virtual machine in the cloud. A benefit of this approach is that the
                    cost of doing this is fixed and there are fewer security issues as the pi won&rsquo;t be on the
                    public internet.</p>
                <p>The instructions should work from a Mac or PC (using windows subsystem for linux) as the local
                    machine. The cloud machine will be linux as this is the most common operating system in the cloud -
                    even on the Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure cloud platform.</p>
                <p><strong>The warning no cloud tutorial is without</strong> The cloud can be many things, but one thing
                    it is not is free. Although many cloud platforms have free credits for new users, it is important to
                    look at the cost of services before using them, to regularly monitor usage and costs and to turn
                    things off - otherwise things can get expensive.</p>

                        href="#1--setting-up-a-virtual-machine-in-the-cloud">#</a></h2>
                <p>In this example we use a virtual machine (VM) from the cloud provider <a
                        href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>. Digital Ocean call their virtual
                    machines Droplets, but in practice there is a lot of similarity between cloud providers' virtual
                    machines. In large part this is because they are mostly linux based, although size and capacity (and
                    hence cost) can vary a lot. Using a virtual machine from another provider such as Amazon Web
                    Service&rsquo;s (AWS) EC2 instances is not dissimilar, although in the case of AWS there are some
                    different actions in the set-up and the billing is not capped.</p>
                <p>After having created an account, navigate to the <em>Create</em> button in Digital Ocean and select
                    <em>Droplets</em> from the dropdown.
                    <img loading="lazy" src="https://johnardavies.github.io/droplet_setup.png"
                        alt="Starting digital ocean" />

                    We select an Ubuntu instance version of linux on the smallest plan cost which is $5 a month. We
                    choose a local datacenter and a form of authentification. From the authentification options we use
                    Secure Shell (SSH) key based authentification, rather than password based login as this is more
                    secure as it prevents someone guessing the password. If you don&rsquo;t have an existing key to set
                    up go to the <strong>New SSH Key</strong> button and follow the steps. To generate a key run
                    <code>$ ssh-keygen</code> from the command line which will then prompt you to save and name the keys
                    giving it a password. This will generate two keys: The private one (id_rsa) and the public one
                    (id_rsa.pub) - these are the default names for a new key which will be saved to the ssh folder. Use
                    <code>$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> to see the public key and copy and paste this into the
                    indicated field.
                </p>
                <p>Select the number of droplets you want to launch. In this case 1 and give the droplet a hostname such
                    as <strong>test-virtual-machine</strong>. Finally when all the fields are finished hit the
                    <strong>Create Droplet</strong> button at the bottom and the droplet will launch.</p>
                <p>The droplet will then launch and its details will be visible (including what its ip address is) under
                    the <strong>Droplets</strong> tab under <strong>Manage</strong>.
                    <img loading="lazy" src="https://johnardavies.github.io/droplet_screen.jpg" alt="Droplet screen" />
                </p>
                <p>If you replace the ip_address below with the Droplet&rsquo;s IP address and you should be able to log
                    in from your local machine&rsquo;s command line using:
                    <code>$ ssh root@ip_address</code><br>
                    if you have multiple ssh keys add the -i flag to add the path to the specific private key you are
                    using:
                    <code>$ ssh -i /path/to/private_key username@ip_address</code>
                    <br>
                    The first time you do this you will asked:<br>
                    <code>Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?</code>
                    Type yes and hit enter and you should see something like the screen below.
                    <img loading="lazy" src="https://johnardavies.github.io/welcome_screen.jpg" alt="Welcome screen" />

                    <br>
                    You now have a machine that, until you turn it off, can run programmes that you want remotely or act
                    as web server 24/7. However, as stands it could be more secure so we take some steps to address
                    this.

                        class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-increasing-the-security-of-the-machine">#</a></h2>
                <p>Unfortunately this stage is necessary as with the virtual machine on the public internet it will
                    quickly be subject to repeated login attempts from bots around the world who are trying to break in.
                </p>
                <p>If you want to see these <code>$ lastb  | more</code> from the command line of the virtual machine
                    will show you a list of failed login attempts on your virtual machine (The more command makes the
                    list scrollable which quickly becomes necessary given the number of login attempts).<br>
                    <em>A small sample of unwanted visitors</em>
                    <img loading="lazy" src="https://johnardavies.github.io/unwanted_visitors.jpg"
                        alt="Unwanted visitors" />
                </p>
                <p>To help make the virtual machine more secure we therefore:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Activate a Firewall for the virtual machine which restricts how it can be accessed</li>
                    <li>Create an account which has restricted privileges and only allows access to the machine via that
                        account</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In AWS a lot of this is handled through what are known as Identity and Access Managment (IAM) roles.
                    Here we use a standard linux firewall and restrictions on who has access privileges so this is less
                    dependent on the specifics of Digital Ocean. The commands here should be executed on the virtual
                    machine.</p>
                <p><strong>2.1 Activate a Firewall</strong><br>
                    To reduce the scope for this we lock down all but one of the ports using a firewall leaving the only
                    means of access the login ssh.</p>
                <p><strong>1.</strong>Installing Uncomplicated Fire Wall (UFW). It should already be installed, but if
                    not, this will install the latest version. The cursor now appears as # as we are logged in as root
                    (The account with the highest level of privilege).<br>
                    <code># apt install ufw</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
                </p>
                <p><strong>2.</strong> Enable ufw to run. The default is to deny all incoming connections and allow all
                    outgoing connections.<br>
                    <code># ufw enable</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
                </p>
                <p><strong>3.</strong> Check to see if ufw is running.<br>
                    <code># ufw status</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
                </p>
                <p><strong>4.</strong> Allow ssh connections. This will allow us to only connect with ssh on port 22,
                    which is the standard port for SSH.<br>
                    <code># ufw allow ssh</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
                </p>
                <p><strong>5.</strong> Restrict the rate at which SSH connections can be formed - this blocks
                    connections from IPs that have attempted 6 or more connections in past 30 seconds.<br>
                    <code># ufw limit ssh</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
                </p>
                <p><strong>2.2 Create a new user account and prevent access with unrestricted privileges</strong>\</p>
                <p>We create a user account which we will use to log into the virtual machine going ahead and then
                    delete the direct root access. The reason for doing this is that the default way of logging in with
                    root access gives the user unlimited privileges on the virtual machine, so if someone broke in with
                    the root access default they can do what they want - including locking us out of the system.
                    Allowing access to the root privileges from a new account
                    only with a password restricts this from happening as someone who got access to the machine would
                    also need to force the password to get this level of control.</p>
                <p><strong>1.</strong> To create a new user account, here called new_user. It will ask you for a
                    password for root access and to input some information on the user.<br>
                    <code># adduser new_user</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
                </p>
                <p><strong>2.</strong> Give the user &lsquo;new_user&rsquo; the admin privileges.<br>
                    <code># usermod -aG sudo new_user</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
                </p>
                <p><strong>3.</strong> Check you can get the admin privileges. It will prompt you for the new_user
                    password.<br>
                    <code># su - new_user</code> after this it will switch to
                    <code>new_user@test-virtual-machine</code>.
                    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
                </p>
                <p><strong>4.</strong> Assuming we want to use the same key for the new user copy the key details over
                    to the new user.
                    <code># rsync --archive --chown=new_user:new_user ~/.ssh /home/new_user</code>\
                    <em>Check ~/.ssh is not written as ~/.ssh/ as if this happens it will copy the whole directory and
                        not just the key</em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
                </p>
                <p><strong>5.</strong> Now log out and check you can ssh into the virtual machine as the new user. It
                    will ask for the key password.<br>
                    <code>$ ssh -i /path/to/private_key new_user@ip_address</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
                </p>
                <p><strong>6.</strong> Assuming you can do all this, edit the sshd_config to forbid root logins.<br>
                    <code>$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
                </p>
                <p>and change the PermitRootLogin line so it reads <code>PermitRootLogin no</code>.</p>
                <p><strong>7.</strong> Restart the service so that the changes take effect.<br>
                    <code>$ sudo service sshd restart</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
                </p>
                <p>From now on log in as the new user
                    <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
                </p>
                <p><code>$ ssh -i /path/to/private_key new_user@ip_address</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
                </p>
                <p>There are further security restrictions one can implement such as <strong>Fail2Ban</strong> which
                    will block ip addresses if they make incorrect login attempts more than a set number of times. If
                    the virtual machine is on for an extended length of time it is also important to make sure it is
                    kept up to date, using <code>$ sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade</code>. The update
                    command updates the list of available packages and upgrade installs the latest version of the
                    packages that the machine has.`</p>
                <p><strong>2.3 Turning things off</strong></p>
                <p>To log out of the virtual machine
                    <code>$ exit</code> will log you out.
                </p>
                <p>To stop the virtual machine running and delete its contents permenantly<br>
                    <code>$ shutdown -h now</code>
                </p>
                <p>You can turn droplets off which will maintain their state if you relaunch them (although you will
                    still be billed for them while stopped) or destroy them which will remove them completely.
                    The terminology is similar with AWS where EC2 virtual machine instances are &lsquo;stopped&rsquo;
                    and &lsquo;destroyed&rsquo;</p>
