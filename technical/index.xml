Reinforcement learning In reinforcement learning we have an agent that wants to optimise its outcomes from operating in an environment e.g. a player playing a game, a person consuming and saving, a car driving through a street etc. The agent takes actions which affect the state of the environment and gives it corresponding payoffs. Actions at a given point in time can also affect the future environment, actions and payoffs.</description>
